# How To: pysc2

## Preface
As I explore pysc2 I'm going to document my experiences here in the form of tutorials so you can follow along and build a StarCraft II bot of your own.

In order to keep things simple I will restrict the bot's race to Terran, at least for the first draft. I may expand on the tutorial if it becomes financially viable to do so.

While  I have many years of experience as a software engineer, my experience with Python is limited. If you see a mistake or some code that could be improved, please let me know.
